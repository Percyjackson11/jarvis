 PITCH DECK
Existing smart home and office systems often fall
 short by offering generic automation that lacks
 personalization and also raises data security
 concerns.
 There is a need for a highly personalized, secure,
 and autonomous automation system that adapts to
 individual user needs and integrates seamlessly
 with a wide range of devices.
What It Is: JARVIS is a smart home
 automation system that acts like a personal
 assistant for your home or office.
 What It Does: It controls various devices and
 systems, such as lights, security cameras,
 and even appliances, all through voice
 commands or automation. It can also surf
 internet, scrape out useful information and
 do research.
How It’s Different: Unlike other systems, JARVIS
 is highly personalized, learning and adapting
 to your unique preferences and needs.
 Main Features: It integrates with different gadgets,
 enhances home security, and makes daily tasks
 easier by automating routines.
Privacy Focus: Your data is secure with JARVIS,
 as it’s designed to ensure your information stays
 private and protected. Also, it won’t be sending
 data to unknown servers because your data will
 be saved on your local home server.
 Future Vision: The goal is to make JARVIS a
 central, intelligent part of every home or office,
 offering a tailored and efficient experience.
Highly Personalized
 Automation:
 JARVIS offers a deeply customizable smart home
 experience, tailoring functionality to individual preferences
 and behaviors, unlike generic solutions that provide one
size-fits-all automation.

 measures, minimizing reliance on external servers and
 reducing potential privacy risks compared to current
 systems like Alexa and Google Home.
