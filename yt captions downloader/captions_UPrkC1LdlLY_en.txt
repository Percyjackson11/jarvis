I just built this bunker,
and these two people who 
never met each other are
going to attempt to live down here
for the next 100 days.
Take your blindfolds off.
Hugo, this is Rayne.
- Rayne, this is Hugo.
- Nice to meet you.
This is their first time ever meeting.
And this is the nuclear bunker
they will call home.
Everything you would need to live
for the next 100 days is in this bunker.
You can even grow your own vegetables.
- Cool.
- If you come over here.
You&#39;ll find your bedroom.
All 40 feet underground.
- Wait, what?
- Oh my God.
- Above you is a bed.
- Nice.
And here&#39;s another bed.
And most importantly, over here
is your half $1 million.
- Dude. It&#39;s real.
- Well, it better be.
If both of you
stay in here for 100 days.
You keep it.
But if one of you leaves, you
both get nothing.
We&#39;re not leaving.
100 days, you could have 
half a million dollars.
- Wow. 
- That&#39;s so much money.
Okay.
let&#39;s see if they survive 100 days.
I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re actually here.
Isn&#39;t it crazy? 
Like this is our new house.
- I know. 
- You&#39;re my roommate now.
We&#39;re not going to see the sun
for 100 days.
If we can grow our own food,
we&#39;re here to be set.
So far,
they seem to be getting along.
But little did they know,
that wasn&#39;t going to last for long.
You are so stupid.
You&#39;re a monster.
I don&#39;t like you, dude.
Hey, hey.
We&#39;re getting ready for night one.
Hopefully we don&#39;t fall off tonight.
- Good night, Hugo.
- Goodnight, Rayne.
Good morning.
I will say I don&#39;t like that 
I don&#39;t know what time it is.
We didn&#39;t know each other
at this time yesterday.
We didn&#39;t.
Now we&#39;re just cooking breakfast.
And even though
these two literally just met,
they&#39;re going to have to work
together.
If they want to win half $1 million.
However, like always,
there&#39;s going to be a twist.
That does look a little sus, 
that little thing right down there.
Hey, yo, what is that?
Why are these boxes locked?
I don&#39;t know, man.
There&#39;s something going on here
we don&#39;t know about.
See this button right here? 
Don&#39;t touch it.
It represents
the twist of the century.
But to find out about that,
they&#39;re going to have to wait
until day ten.
That is, of course, if they
don&#39;t die from boredom first.
What do you want to do today?
I&#39;m going to learn
how to play guitar.
Why do I need a radio
when I can be the radio?
What the heck?
Over the next hundred days, 
I&#39;m going to learn Spanish.
It&#39;s our third day in the bunker.
Let&#39;s go. We&#39;re going to come out
so ripped at the end of this.
You&#39;re my new favorite human
in this world.
You&#39;re the coolest person
I know down here.
What?
And by day four, the challenges
of living with a stranger 
were becoming more apparent.
I got to tell you something.
You were snoring bad last night,
actually.
Sorry.
Some earplugs would be nice, but
it&#39;s okay.
If Rayne ever annoys me,
this&#39;ll just freak her out.
This is our view of the outside.
It&#39;s just dirt.
So gross to look at.
Hey hey hey.
But since leaving would cost him
half $1 million,
they were going to have to make
the best of it.
I made enough salad for both of us.
I am so bored.
Today we&#39;re building
a throne of canned food.
I&#39;m Hugo.
I&#39;m Rayne.
- And this is life in the bunker.
- And this is life in the bunker.
No!
And once they got to day 10, 
it was time for my special offer.
Wow. It&#39;s Jimmy.
All right.
I think it&#39;s time I show you guys
the twist of this video.
There&#39;s
two boxes on each side of the room.
- Yeah, we saw that earlier.
- What do you think&#39;s behind you?
- A button?
- A button.
Oh my God.
A hand scanner.
And on the other side,
another hand scanner.
Oh, and one more thing.
A one minute timer.
Hey, Chandler, do the thing.
Finally.
As you&#39;ll see, 
the timer&#39;s now counting down.
If you let that timer ever hit zero, your
money will instantly be engulfed in flames,
incinerating every single dollar
of that half a million.
And to stop your money from burning.
You two are going to have to work
together.
It&#39;s pretty simple.
Put your hands on those scanners,
and there you go.
The timer stopped.
So every single day, at some random time, 
this will happen.
- Every single day? 
- Every day.
- What if I&#39;m showering?
- I don&#39;t care the reason why.
If you guys mess up just one time,
both of you
are leaving with nothing.
- Oh my gosh.
- See you in a couple of days.
Oh my God.
I won&#39;t be able to sleep
comfortably. Ever.
- Yeah, yeah.
- For 100 days.
If we mess up one time, we&#39;re done.
- We should move our beds down here.
- Okay.
I still feel this weight on my
chest, but only goes off once a day.
But it could be at any time.
I&#39;m not going to lie.
I am a lot more stressed out.
Just having that lingering
feeling that the button
could be pressed at any moment.
Oh my God. Rayne, Rayne, Rayne, Rayne.
Go go go go.
Oh, God.
That scared me.
Dude, my heart just dropped to my toes.
Well, it&#39;s not going to go off 
again today, so.
And after the daily alarm,
Hugo and Rayne spent their free time
reading
and learning to work together.
This is Beast Boot Camp.
Get down and give me two.
And honestly,
it seemed like they were on track
to win this half $1 million.
But to test their strength
as a team, one morning
I visited them at 6am 
to press the alarm
To see if I could trip them up.
Oh my God, hurry!
But they were still pretty fast.
However, Hugo and Rayne weren&#39;t
just quick at my alarm, considering
it only took them 13 days
to find the surprise
I had hidden under the floorboards.
Is that a latch?
There&#39;s no way
we&#39;re supposed to know about this.
Tying up.
No way.
This is like a whole
other world. There&#39;s so much.
And now that they&#39;re equipped
with the world&#39;s best chocolate.
Hugo and Rayne were really 
starting to get into the groove
of saving their money
from burning every day.
- Let&#39;s do this.
- We got this, Rayne, we got this.
And with every day gone by,
they were one day
closer to winning $500,000.
We scare the alarm.
The alarm doesn&#39;t scare us.
From now on, every ten days,
I&#39;ll bring them a new offer.
And since it&#39;s day 20.
Nolan, can you hear
us?
- Yeah. 
- Press the button.
You guys
have gotten very good at this.
And literally do it
in a couple seconds every time.
Which makes me wonder,
do you even need a minute anymore?
- Yeah.
- We would like it.
- Yeah.
- We definitely... Yeah.
Let&#39;s see how much you&#39;d like it.
I will add an extra $50,000
to your prize pool.
For a grand total of $550,000.
If you let me shrink this one minute
timer down to 30 seconds.
Really think about it.
Because the next 80 days,
you will only have 30 seconds to place
both of your hands on these.
If you miss once.
$550,000 burns instead of 500,000.
Let&#39;s think about this.
This is a lot of money on the line.
Now we&#39;re about to shrink the timer
and make everything harder.
Is $50,000 worth it?
I don&#39;t know.
We&#39;ve been here in less than 10s
every time.
I think we
can do it. We should do it.
Let&#39;s go.
Let&#39;s do it.
We&#39;re doing it.
It will now permanently rest at 30 seconds.
Nolan.
Here comes the money.
As promised.
Here&#39;s your $50,000.
Hopefully it doesn&#39;t get you out.
I&#39;m not going to lie, 
that may have been a stupid decision.
No, you can&#39;t say that now.
Actually,
it was a phenomenal decision.
You see, not once did they
even come close to failing.
Each day getting to the hand scanner 
in under 10 seconds.
Rayne, we got this alarm thing in the bag.
Now it&#39;s like don&#39;t get too bored
in here.
So with day 30 offer.
Let&#39;s see if we can take
the difficulty up a notch.
It&#39;s day
30, and I have another offer.
Instead of telling you the offer.
I&#39;m going to show you.
Press the button.
Oh, it&#39;s quiet.
That&#39;s my offer.
$50,000 will be added to the prize pool
bring it up to $600,000.
But there will be no noise
when the alarm goes off every day.
I&#39;ll give you guys
some time to discuss it.
Yeah.
We won&#39;t get the alarm back.
What if this is the last money
offer?
We got $550,000.
We&#39;ve been able to protect so far.
Is that not enough?
We would have to take shifts from
now on until the challenge is done.
Do you want to do that?
Dude, it&#39;s so much money.
All right, guys,
it&#39;s time to decide.
Do you want
$50,000 added to your prize pool?
If you let me turn off the sound?
As much as we would like it.
- We can&#39;t.
- We&#39;re passing.
Really?
You can both buy Teslas.
We could already buy Teslas, though.
- You can buy more Teslas.
- I only need one car.
All right, I&#39;ll see you in...
I don&#39;t know, sometime
in the future.
See you later. Maybe.
I can&#39;t believe we said no.
Jimmy just offered me $50,000.
Who says no to that?
Rayne.
Say no to that much money hurts.
He&#39;ll come around to it.
He&#39;ll get over it.
I think we made the right decision.
So in an attempt
to recover their relationship,
they moved all their food supplies
out of the way to paint a mural
for their new team
name, the Sewer Rats.
Dang, I crushed that.
Yeah. You&#39;re welcome.
But it wasn&#39;t enough
because Hugo was still frustrated
that he was doing
most of the chores,
such as feeding the fish
and cleaning their tank.
- This is gross.
- Oh my gosh.
And maintaining the garden.
So they never ran out of fresh
vegetables?
Yeah. Good job, good job.
- What would I do without Hugo? 
- Die!
And on top of that, Hugo had done
most of the cooking himself.
And since they were eating
three times a day,
that meant he had cooked over 100
meals for the both of them.
Oh, my God, you&#39;re
like my own personal Waffle House.
Don&#39;t disrespect me like that.
And while the tension
was continuing to grow between them,
my day 40 offer wasn&#39;t going 
to make things any easier.
And before we go in the bunker,
it&#39;s time to bring out the sucker.
- Nolan?
- I was going to say that
- The money sucker.
- Okay.
To kick off day 40.
Hey, Chandler, do the thing.
Chandler and Tareq
are currently aboveground
vacuuming up a $100,000,
which you have not lost.
- We&#39;re doing it. 
- It&#39;s sucking.
And for the next ten minutes,
if one of you leaves,
you can walk away with the $100,000
they just vacuumed out,
and the other person
won&#39;t be eliminated.
But you&#39;d be abandoning your teammate
to be
isolated in this bunker
to win the other 450 grand.
If one of you want to leave,
now&#39;s the chance.
Maybe I could leave.
I do everything around here.
I do all the cooking.
I take care of the plants.
I even entertain you with how bad
I am at the guitar.
I think I might leave.
- No you can&#39;t. 
- I think I am.
We were supposed to be Sewer Rats together.
We can do this, dude.
Where&#39;s your Sewer Rat mind, dude?
If you want to say
yes to the next offer, I&#39;ll say yes.
Whatever Hugo wants. 
I&#39;ll shake on that.
I feel like
he&#39;s still going to take the ladder.
All right.
Is either one of you getting $100,000
stuffed in the back of your car right now?
I&#39;m going to say no.
I&#39;m sorry.
- But I&#39;m staying. 
- No.
Let&#39;s go.
I&#39;ll go
put the 100 grand back in the pot.
See you in ten days, then.
And even though
they ultimately decided
to stay together,
Hugo&#39;s hesitation was testing
the bond of the Sewer Rats.
It almost felt like
when you&#39;re getting broken up with.
Kind of hopeless.
Should I have let him just leave?
- Hugo, what&#39;s your deal?
- You are a little weird.
It was just a little too basic
for my liking.
I&#39;m so okay with being basic.
- I don&#39;t like being basic.
- Okay, but that&#39;s obnoxious.
You&#39;re so stupid.
What did she just say?
Dude, don&#39;t yell at me like that.
That is insane.
I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re making it.
Over the next four days, Hugo and Rayne 
have barely even spoke to each other,
which makes for terrible content.
So I decided to shake things
up in the bunker
by introducing a new variable.
- What?
- That looks like another scanner.
Are they bringing in another person?
That is like my worst nightmare.
I don&#39;t want to trust anybody else.
But I guess we&#39;re going to find out
really soon.
Very soon.
How&#39;s it going?
Hey, Jimbo.
This ladder never gets less sketchy.
I brought you two a friend.
Okay, close your eyes.
Someone who knows a thing or two
about living in unusual places.
I brought Ryan Trahan.
- Okay. 
- You&#39;re a lot shorter in person.
Not cool.
That&#39;s the wrong foot
to get started on,
because he&#39;s going to be spending
the next 50 hours in the bunker
with the two of you.
This is crazy.
Now that you&#39;re a contestant.
That was not supposed to happen.
You have to play by the same rules
as Hugo and Rayne.
I&#39;m a liability.
Okay.
You&#39;ll need to switch into this.
You look thick.
In exactly 50 hours 
is the 50 day mark.
Ryan&#39;s going to be with you guys
until then. Have fun.
Wait, Jimmy, no!
Enjoy Ryan.
- Hey guys.
- Hey.
- Hugo?
- Hugo.
I&#39;m Ryan.
- Ryanalicious.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, buddy.
- New roommates. 
- New roommates.
Guys. I&#39;m shaking.
I&#39;m actually nervous right now.
To be honest, I probably should
have checked Ryan&#39;s bag because...
I brought you something.
Stop it. Beyonce.
It&#39;s her album.
It&#39;s her album, dude.
It&#39;s time
for the first button press.
But I&#39;m gonna wait until they&#39;re very far
away from the hand scanners to press it.
Oh, go go go go go.
Nice.
I&#39;m going to use the restroom real quick.
Okay.
She uses the restroom all the time.
I genuinely cannot fathom
that they have been here
for almost 50 days already.
Hugo and Rayne
do not really like each other,
and it&#39;s actually a threat to them
finishing this 100 day challenge.
You guys spend most of your time during
the days, kind of, like not talking?
- Yeah, 
- Yeah, yeah.
After
spending a whole day with them,
I realize
the entire reason that I&#39;m here
is to make sure that Hugo and Rayne
get to day 100.
So today
we are doing a friendship test.
A friendship test.
The first test is a 60 second stare 
into each other&#39;s souls.
Oh my God.
Okay, you guys ready?
Three. Two. One.
Success!
This is the final question.
Rayne, why do you want to win for Hugo?
This is such a crazy opportunity
for him.
And he&#39;s the biggest fan of MrBeast. 
He&#39;s gotta win.
They pick, like,
such a good person for this video, so.
That&#39;s so true.
Hugo,
why do you want to win for Rayne?
I know how much her family helps her
and literally given her the ability
to do anything.
She really wants to repay to her
parents.
I want to help her really better
their life.
- That&#39;s it, I&#39;m about to cry. 
- Dang, man.
If you guys can just remember
you&#39;re doing it for yourselves,
but also for each other.
- Yeah.
- 100%.
Then this money is yours.
Friendship test complete.
- Thank you.
- You pass.
With Ryan around, it seemed
like things were better than ever.
And when it was finally day 50.
- Jimmy.
- You&#39;re having a party.
They even made a chocolate cake
using Feastables,
which obviously tasted phenomenal.
Happy 50 day to you.
You guys are both incredible
human beings. Come here.
Unfortunately, Ryan, your 50 hours
are now over.
I must escort you out of here.
The first thing I see out
of apocalypse bunker is Nolan&#39;s face.
And he almost
turned back around.
And now that Ryan has left.
What do you think your day 50 offer is?
I personally think
since we&#39;re halfway done
you&#39;re going to cut the time in half.
It&#39;s not far off.
My day 50 offer is for every second 
you take off this timer,
- I&#39;ll add $5,000 to the prize pool.
- I like that.
That&#39;s the offer.
You have ten minutes to decide.
I&#39;m thinking either 10 or 15.
That&#39;s too risky.
You said I can say yes to any
challenge I wanted to if I stayed.
10 seconds down?
- I&#39;m cool with 10.
- Let&#39;s cut that 10.
What are you guys thinking?
We&#39;re cool with cutting down 10 seconds.
I&#39;ll go get the money.
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- There&#39;s your money, 600,000.
And now that I&#39;ve thrown away
another $50,000,
I&#39;m going to once again
leave you in this bunker.
I&#39;ll see you in ten days.
- All right. See you, Jimmy.
- Bye, Jimmy.
Now it&#39;s day 51.
It&#39;s the first morning without Ryan.
So quiet down here now.
So we just experienced 
our first 20 second alarm.
It was a little scary, actually,
to see the alarm down in the teens.
It was scary.
Without Ryan
bringing peace to the bunker.
Hugo and Rayne&#39;s relationship 
was beginning to unravel again.
I want to make it very clear, Hugo,
we don&#39;t have a charger
for this thing.
I&#39;m going to be the only one
to drain this battery.
- I don&#39;t get one song?
- I&#39;ve given you everything.
You get some of my pineapples,
you get all the coffee,
you&#39;re eating my jam right now.
Okay. Okay.
Not like I put my hand on the other
scanner to get her $300,000.
And in an already compact
bunker, Hugo needed to find ways
to make space for himself.
There&#39;s some storage space
in the floor,
and I turned it into a little vibe cave.
No girls allowed.
Got my snacks, my books, and my couch.
Painting with music feels amazing.
You want to come hang out 
in my vibe cave?
Rayne?
What the heck?
And as the days went on,
the tension between Hugo and Rayne
was causing them to make careless mistakes.
I&#39;m going to feed these fish.
Morning, fishes.
Come on. 
Time to eat.
Rayne!
I&#39;m coming!
Rayne!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Rayne!
That took way too long.
I&#39;m not about to lose $300,000
because Rayne doesn&#39;t have
her head in the game.
I&#39;m starting to forget
what my normal life was like.
Waking up in the bunker.
it&#39;s like my normal life doesn&#39;t seem 
like it&#39;s a thing anymore.
It just feels like
it&#39;s a never ending cycle.
But no matter
the case, Hugo and Rayne
were continuously able to prevent me
from igniting their money.
So come day 60, I wanted to see if
I could at least ignite their greed.
Let&#39;s see
who gets to press the button.
I win. No, I win.
Oh, sheesh.
I need to drop something.
Do you mind moving really far away?
Oh, nice.
Sorry about that.
For my day 60 offer,
I will give you this $50,000
if you let me set off the alarm
three times a day instead of one
for the remainder of the challenge.
- Oh my God.
- I&#39;ll let you two converse.
Dude, I really want to do that.
It would be cool to do it.
But I don&#39;t know how likely it is that
they just go off back to back like this.
That would be ideal.
All right.
What are we doing with this $50,000?
Am I adding it to your bank accounts
or not?
- No.
- No.
Really?
I’ll take my money and leave.
I think we made the right choice.
We&#39;ve been pretty uncomfortable,
but we don&#39;t
want to be uncomfortable
for too long.
40 days is still a long time.
And considering
they arrived at my bunker
over two months ago,
by the time day 61 rolled around.
Spring was in full bloom
and so was their restlessness.
I&#39;m kind of tired of like, waking up
and staying in one space all day.
It&#39;s now our new normal
and it&#39;s now no longer fun.
I just don&#39;t want to read anymore. 
Don&#39;t feel like journaling.
I don&#39;t feel like painting.
All the things that used to be fun
are just boring now.
Having shared the same space
together for 60 plus days,
Hugo was now becoming
addicted to the alone time
he was spending in his vibe cave.
I&#39;m gonna go hang out in the vibe
cave and read.
You&#39;ve been reading all day, Hugo.
I think Rayne&#39;s trying to get a little
upset with the amount of reading I do,
but I don&#39;t want to go up there
and do the puzzle anymore.
What? He stopped reading for two seconds.
I think I&#39;m going to hide his books.
Rayne needed to take it into her
own hands if she wanted to gain back
Hugo&#39;s attention.
Did you hide my books?
Did I hide your books?
No.
Now I know you&#39;re
messing with me
because I have another
stack of books right there.
I thought they&#39;re over there.
Like, think about it.
She&#39;s starting to
gaslight me now.
And I&#39;m not gonna lie to you.
I&#39;m pretty upset about it.
You started thinking back to Jimmy&#39;s
offer on day 40.
I could have taken that, but I said
no, because I wanted more money.
So just knowing that
I have no other choice now
because I decided to stay.
I don&#39;t know if I can make it.
After hearing the regret in Hugo&#39;s
voice, I had an offer on day 70
that would be too perfect
for him to pass up.
But as always, first things first.
We need to press the button.
- You closed it.
- I closed it.
- What did you do?
- You turn their lights off.
How&#39;s it going?
We’re good, how are you?
Before I could reveal the day 70 offer, 
I need to split you up.
Hugo. Head upstairs.
Rayne, go by the money.
Time to set up the wall.
These curtains are stressing me out.
What&#39;s going on?
What&#39;s gonna happen?
Hey, Karl,
go ahead and suck the money up.
Sucking 200 grand.
We&#39;re currently sucking up $200,000
out of the $600,000 prize pool.
And similar
to one of my previous offers.
If one of you leaves,
you get to walk away with 100 grand.
I think I might leave.
No, you can&#39;t.
One of you can leave and go home
right now.
You brought the offer back?
Yes, but this time you can walk away
with a guaranteed 200 grand without
eliminating the other person.
Okay.
But unlike my day 40 offer,
I separated you guys
so that this time that she can&#39;t
stop you from leaving.
If you still want to.
That&#39;s spicy.
Oh, my God, Jimmy,
why do you put me through this?
You&#39;d be doing Rayne a favor
because now,
instead of competing for 300 grand,
which is what you both would make
if you chose to stay.
She&#39;s competing for 400 grand.
So by leaving,
you&#39;re actually helping her?
- I do give her 100 grand.
- Yeah.
I don&#39;t know. 
I feel like he might leave.
I don&#39;t know if I can forgive myself 
if I said no to $200k
and I ended up losing this challenge.
And while they&#39;re deciding on
whether or not they want 200 grand,
I&#39;m going to tell you guys
about Monster Hunter Now.
What?
Monster Hunter Now is a free to play
mobile game from Niantic.
Kind of like Pokemon Go.
Does that make either of
you want to play it?
This is awful timing for this.
Come on.
And to really showcase this game,
I need to go to the surface.
Monster Hunter Now encourages you
to go outside and find the monsters.
Let&#39;s say you&#39;re walking a dog.
You can hunt monsters,
or you&#39;re buying Feastables.
You can still fight monsters.
Or I&#39;m on a date.
That&#39;s not realistic, but
the fighting monsters is.
Monster Hunter Now
also gave me my own in-game quests
available
for the next 30 days.
Plus, MrBeast Sword,
shields, and other in-game items.

My quest is only available
for the next 30 days,
so you need to
make sure you hurry.
I almost left at 100 K.
This is double that.
And remember, if you don&#39;t step out,
you still have one month left
in this bunker.
Do you want to see your family?
Do you want to see the sun?
And more importantly,
do you care about
the other person of the bunker
and want them to make an extra 100 grand?
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
Last chance for a guaranteed
$200,000
One.
We&#39;re coming down.
There&#39;s
no way he&#39;s still over there.
I&#39;m now going to pull down these
curtains and reveal if someone left.
Neither of you left.
What?
And since neither of you
left, here&#39;s your $200,000 back.
I&#39;ll see you in ten more days.
I just said no to $200,000.
I&#39;m amazed you said no.
I hope you don&#39;t regret it.
Because I don&#39;t want to hear it.
They may have stayed together,
but the money was the only thing
keeping them here.
I don&#39;t really care
to be doing this anymore.
Sometimes the hardest part of this
challenge isn&#39;t even the alarm.
It&#39;s living with another person.
Especially when they&#39;re
so demanding.
Would you mind making me chicken?
Did you make me scrambled eggs?
Do you think when
you&#39;re done you can make me
a little bit
of eggs and chorizo.
It&#39;s just sucks now.
I&#39;m just tired of doing
all the same thing every day.
I don&#39;t mind helping Rayne,
but this is, like, too much.
If Jimmy came down here and 
offered me 10K to leave right now
I&#39;d probably just dip.
Spending all this time with Rayne
was starting to get to Hugo,
and when their plants started
literally rotting,
Rayne was hesitant to get her hands
dirty.
Yeah,
if you just get that nasty water out.
Well, you&#39;re not going to help here?
- No, you got this.
- Thanks, Rayne.
I&#39;m going to do cartwheels.
The smell.
So I don&#39;t know why, but
I asked Rayne to give me a haircut.
And of course,
she messed that up too.
Destroying
Hugo&#39;s hair was the last straw,
and his morale
was at an all time low.
- I think I want to leave. 
- Go ahead.
The money&#39;s going to burn
and we&#39;ll both win nothing.
I could tell
that they were struggling.
So let&#39;s see if my next offer cheers
them up or makes it way worse.
I&#39;m going to ask you two a question,
and if you answer correctly,
I will not press the button
for the next 10 days.
- You&#39;ll have 10 days off. 
- 10 days free would be crazy.
But if you answer incorrectly,
I&#39;m going to shave
five seconds off the timer.
Oh, I think I know exactly
what you&#39;re about to ask.
The question is,
which tastes better?
A Feastables chocolate bar 
or a Hershey&#39;s chocolate bar?
Pretty obvious, Feastables.
She&#39;s right.
This is great.
That was easy.
For the next 10 days, I&#39;m
not going to press the red button.
You guys should catch up on sleep
because day 90 won&#39;t be so easy.
Rayne, Rayne, the alarm.
Oh my God.
I&#39;ll see you two then.
- I&#39;ll say we can just cover this up. 
- Dude. You&#39;re right.
See you in 10 days timer.
And so, despite all the tension
that&#39;s been building up
between them, removing
the alarm might have been
the exact thing
that these two needed
to start getting along.
Since we don&#39;t have an alarm.
I could do whatever I want.
So that&#39;s what I&#39;m
doing.
On the menu today.
Donuts.
Rayne said she would never 
ever cook or bake.
My roommate is over there
making some donuts right now, dude.
And they look great.
Thanks, Hugo. 
All right, here are the donuts.
Taste test.
Feastables chocolate covered donut.
Oh, my God, Feastables is so good.
And since Feastables single
handedly saved their friendship,
the rest of the 80s
went by like a breeze.
And so they decided
to use their extra time
from each day to prepare for
what was to come.
What we should be doing
is preparing for day 90.
Let&#39;s get this game plan together
and let&#39;s make sure we win.
I&#39;m going to have Hugo time me
running from different areas
in the bunker to the hand scanner.
Using the stopwatch on the
MP3 player Ryan gave us.
Go.
2.61.
That&#39;s... okay, okay.
Go!
4.09.
Okay, cool, cool, cool, 
cool, cool. Still under five.
Go.
3.87, 3.57.
Okay.
3.39.
Day 90 to 100, it&#39;s going to be war.
Go hard
or go home.
I&#39;m going to go hard
because I&#39;m not going home.
The timer comes back
tomorrow on day 90.
But after all this training, we got this.
Time to take the sign down.
There she is.
It&#39;s officially day 90, which means
it&#39;s time for the first button push
in over ten days.
The button pressing is back.
- Did you miss the button?
- Surprisingly little bit.
Okay, coming down,
here is a $100,000 
to add to your prize pool.
And I&#39;ll give it to you right now,
increasing your balance to $700,000.
And in exchange for this money,
I&#39;m actually going to give you
more time on the counter,
raising it from 20 seconds
to one entire minute.
However, once you scan your hands
each day, the timer will not reset
and that one minute
will have to last you for the last
ten days of the challenge.
Okay.
We&#39;ll give you one minute
to think on it.
What do you think?
What do you think?
- It&#39;s kind of scary, but... 
- This is a lot of money.
Our math is there.
We&#39;ve averaged
less than five seconds every time.
Every time.
- All in.
- All right.
- Go hard or go home.
- Go hard or go home.
Jimmy,
we made our decision.
- All right, what is your decision?
- We&#39;re going to do it.
- You sure?
- Yes.
No takesie backsies.
Adding it to the money pile.
All right.
- Go hard or go home, that&#39;s what it is.
- Jimmy, I&#39;ll see you in 10 days.
Since we officially have
$700,000 on the line
and only 60 seconds, it&#39;s time
we redecorate a little bit.
We&#39;ve set up the bunker,
so we don&#39;t have to move more
than a foot away from the scanner.
We even brought all the food
we need over here.
We&#39;ve been in here for 90 days,
and it all comes down to this.
Let&#39;s see how we turn off the alarm
from our new seating area.
1.11.
That&#39;s crazy.
Every second literally counts.
And terrified
that we would press the button.
These two waited by their hand
scanners literally all day.
And so of course, when we pushed
the button, they were ready.
- Let&#39;s go.
- Holy...
That was their fastest one, ever.
Yes.
And so they went to bed.
But little did they know, it was now past
midnight, which meant it was a new day.
And all we had to do was
wait for them to fall asleep.
They were literally asleep,
and it took them two seconds.
They didn&#39;t fall for it,
but I knew that at some point they
were going to have to use the bathroom.
So I waited for the moment
when they got
as far away from the scanners
as possible.
Rayne, Rayne, the alarm.
Nice.
Nice dude, you came down there flying.
All right. I think we can
afford one bathroom break.
Excuse me.
- Yes. 
- Get back over here.
Don&#39;t you dare
Get back over here.
Don&#39;t you take a step farther, Hugo.
Hugo.
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, come.
That took five seconds.
Dang it, that&#39;s slow.
You&#39;re not allowed
to use the restroom anymore.
I really want that to be
the only five second alarm
that we get from now on.
So no using the restroom tomorrow?
We&#39;re just going to have to hold it
until the alarm goes off.
I&#39;m going to paint a line on the
ground, so that way he knows his limits,
how far he can go,
how far he can&#39;t go.
Here&#39;s the line.
Rayne&#39;s bathroom rule 
might have been intense,
but for the next few days,
the rule actually kept Hugo on track
for every day&#39;s alarm.
But on day 98, Hugo started
slipping into old habits.
Hugo! Hugo!
Come on, come on, come on, 
come on, come on.
- How long did that take?
- 6.01.
Hugo, you went over the six
second time limit.
I mean, I ran as fast as I could.
The longest amount of time
that we&#39;ve taken to turn off
these alarms
is because you&#39;re in the bathroom.
Do you not see a problem?
Do you not see it?
Am I no longer allowed 
to use the bathroom ever?
Hugo,
- don&#39;t play with it.
- But I&#39;m not playing with it.
I&#39;m just peeing.
And through all the tension,
Hugo took the next opportunity
to speak his mind.
Rayne is showering
and this is the last time I have time 
to tell you how I feel about her.
Unfiltered.
It obviously hasn&#39;t been easy
because she was a stranger first,
and we are two completely separate
people.
Seriously, I wouldn&#39;t choose
another partner to do this with.
I&#39;m grateful
I was put in here with someone
who wants to win as bad as she does,
and someone that really pushes me
to just be the best every day.
Hey dude, that was nice of you.
You weren&#39;t supposed to hear that.
I really appreciate that, though.
Like, we have gotten a lot closer
throughout this challenge, and...
Both of our just determination to win,
Yeah.
As much as I did at the beginning, 
we were like,
like, brushing each other off, like,
not really listening.
Once we got to know each other,
it wasn&#39;t us
wanting to just win anymore.
It was like, I&#39;m going to win this
for you
- And  you&#39;re going to win it for me.
- I&#39;m going to win this for you.
Happy day 100.
I&#39;m heading down for the last time.
Unless someone nukes our country
100 days.
All for this.
You both ready?
- Dude! Yeah.
- We&#39;re ready.
- You sure? 
- We&#39;re ready.
Karl!
Yes?
Press the button.
Dude.
- You ready?
- The final button press.
All right, y&#39;all
take a little too long.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go.
Yeah, come on, come on.
Ready?
Come on, Hugo.
Don&#39;t mess this up.
Hugo, come on.
All right.
Yes!
It&#39;s been a hundred days.
Go on up.
This is crazy.
This is their first time seeing 
the sun in 100 days.
Yes! God.
Oh, my God.
I missed you guys so much.
Yes.
As promised, here&#39;s
your 350 grand.
And Rayne, here is your 350 grand.
I&#39;ll see you around.
